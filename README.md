Project Overview
This project aims to explore the impact of dividend policy on the financial performance of companies listed in the Nifty 50 index. By analyzing data from 35 companies over a ten-year period (2011-2021), the study investigates how various factors, such as dividend yield, current ratio, and leverage ratio, influence key performance metrics like Return on Equity (ROE).

Objectives
To assess the effect of dividend policy on the financial performance of companies.
To identify key financial indicators that influence company performance.
To provide insights and strategies for corporate management and investors based on the findings.
Key Findings
Positive Impact of Dividend Yield: Dividend yield has a significant positive effect on the performance of companies, indicating that higher dividends are generally associated with better financial outcomes.
Effect of Current and Leverage Ratios: The study found that both the current ratio and leverage ratio moderately influence ROE, providing insights into liquidity and financial stability.
Regression Analysis: Multiple regression analysis revealed a strong relationship between dividend policy and share performance, supporting the hypothesis that dividend policy is a critical factor in company performance.
Methodology
Data Collection: Collected financial data of 35 companies included in the Nifty 50 index from 2011 to 2021.
Statistical Analysis: Used EViews software for data analysis, including multiple regression and correlation analysis, to evaluate the impact of dividend policy on financial performance.
Key Variables:
Independent Variable: Dividend Yield
Dependent Variable: Company Performance (measured by ROE, ROA, etc.)
Control Variables: Current Ratio, Leverage Ratio
Conclusions
The study concludes that a well-structured dividend policy positively impacts company performance.
Companies should focus on maintaining a balanced dividend yield to enhance profitability and attract investors.
A robust dividend policy can serve as a strategic tool for corporate management to signal financial health and stability to shareholders.
